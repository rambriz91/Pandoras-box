# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

This assignment required me to modify existing javascript code to create an application that allows employees to create a random password after inputing a password length between 8-128 characters and indicating which charactersets they want to include in their password.

## Tasks 

- Created a prompt that requests a user input for character length between 8-128
- Created an alert when the password is generated and if the length does not fall within the prompts parameters
- Created conditional statements where user confirms if they want Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Special Characters.
- A randomizer function that runs a for loop to determine the random characters.

## Usage
